# Learning Newton's Method
This repo contains an academic project developed for the course of Computational Mathematics (a.y.2017/2018) at the University of Bologna, aimed at explaining in a creative way how the Newton's method works.

#### How to use the "inputExp" configuration file
inputExp contains a list of functions and parameters used to configure the Newton method's exercise shown in the slide "Esercizio" in the file LearningNewtonsMethod.nb.

Each row has the format
function,a,b,x0

where
- function: the function that will be drawn, it must be specified in the Mathematica language.
e.g. Sin[x] and not sin(x)
- a: left bound of the plotting interval
- b: right bound of the plotting interval
- x0: first given approximation of zero
